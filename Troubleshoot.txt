HELP NOTES TO DEVELOP CHATBOT AND TALKBOT

Installation of chatterbot package
• If installing in command prompt using pip
pip install chatterbot
• The chatterbot 0.8.6 is a stable version till date, if you wish to install it instead
pip install chatterbot==0.8.6
• If you’re installing in environments like Jupyter Notebook or Spyder directly,
then use !pip instead of pip
!pip install chatterbot
!pip install chatterbot==0.8.6

Solutions for some common troubles
NO MODULE
1. Ensure stable internet connection while installing
2. Ensure successful installation of sub-packages (that are installed automatically
with other packages) like pyYAML
3. If installation of pyYAML has failed, use --user, execute below lines one after
the other.
a. pip install --user --ignore-installed pyYAML
b. pip install --user chatterbot==0.8.6
4. Clock attribute error has been reported several times during installation. It is
interpreted to be a Python version specific error, not sure though. Upgrade or
degrade to other Python 3.x.y versions if necessary.
5. Do not forget to restart kernel after installing a new package (in environments
like Jupyter Notebook, Spyder etc.,)
6. Ensure that you have not named any of your programs similar to that of any
library installed. If there are similar names, there will be file conflicts resulting
in this error or an ‘IDLE sub process connection failed’ error.
EOL ERROR
7. Check for punctuation errors in program. In windows, file location addresses
should be represented with / instead of backlash (\). e.g. Folder1/Folder2/File
PYAUDIO
8. If you have to use PyAudio package but facing installation problems, installing
using the wheel file may be helpful. You may download wheel file at:
https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudio
Once downloaded, change the current working directory to the location where
the wheel file is available and then install as given below:
pip install COMPLETE_NAME_OF_THE_WHEEL_FILE
(or)
If your system supports, these commands may be helpful instead
pip install pipwin
pipwin install PyAudio
